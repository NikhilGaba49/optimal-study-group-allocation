# Optimal Study Group Allocation

This project aims to create an optimal allocation of students into study groups by considering various constraints and preferences. The goal is to improve collaboration, learning efficiency, and group satisfaction through an algorithmic approach.

## Project Description

Forming effective study groups is key to maximizing student engagement and performance. This repository contains Python code that leverages optimization and heuristic techniques to assign students into balanced groups based on their skills, availability, and other relevant attributes.

The solution supports flexible input data formats and allows customization of constraints to fit different educational settings.

## Features

- Input parsing for student attributes and preferences  
- Multiple allocation strategies with optimization algorithms  
- Constraint handling including group size limits and compatibility  
- Output generation for allocated groups in clear formats  
- Modular code to extend algorithms or incorporate new criteria
